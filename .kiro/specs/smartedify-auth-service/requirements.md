# SmartEdify Auth Service - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SmartEdify Auth Service is a comprehensive authentication and authorization microservice designed for the SmartEdify platform. This service will handle user registration, authentication, JWT token management, and session control for a multi-tenant educational platform. The service must support secure authentication flows, token-based authorization, and provide robust security measures while maintaining high performance and scalability.

The service will be built using Go with the Fiber framework, PostgreSQL for data persistence, Redis for session management, and will follow OpenID Connect standards for interoperability.

### Context and Scope

- **Platform**: SmartEdify - Educational technology platform
- **Architecture**: Microservices with Docker containerization
- **Target Users**: Students, teachers, administrators across multiple educational institutions
- **Scale**: Support for 10,000+ concurrent users across 100+ tenants
- **Compliance**: GDPR, FERPA (educational data privacy), and SOC 2 requirements
- **Integration**: Must integrate with existing SmartEdify services and third-party educational tools

### Key Success Metrics

- Authentication response time: < 200ms (95th percentile)
- System availability: 99.9% uptime
- Security incidents: Zero successful unauthorized access attempts
- User satisfaction: < 1% authentication-related support tickets
